    A Fabric script (based on the file 1-pack_web_static.py) that distributes
    an archive to your web servers, using the function do_deploy:
    - Prototype: def do_deploy(archive_path):
    - Returns False if the file at the path archive_path doesnâ€™t exist
    - The script should take the following steps:
        - Upload the archive to the /tmp/ directory of the web server
        - Uncompress the archive to the folder
        /data/web_static/releases/<archive filename without extension>
        on the web server
        - Delete the archive from the web server
        - Delete the symbolic link /data/web_static/current from the web server
        - Create a new the symbolic link /data/web_static/current on the web
        server, linked to the new version of your code
        (/data/web_static/release/<archive filename without extension>)
    - All remote commands must be executed on your both web servers
    (using env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02'] variable in your script)
    - Returns True if all operations have been done correctly, otherwise
    returns False
    - You must use this script to deploy it on your servers: xx-web-01 and
    xx-web-02
